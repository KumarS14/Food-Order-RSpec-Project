# Food-Order-RSpec-Project

This repository showcases my skills in test-driven development, object-oriented design, and debugging, as part of the Golden Square module. The project focuses on creating a food ordering system that provides the following functionality:

## Features

- **Menu Display**: Customers can view a list of dishes with their respective prices to check available options before ordering.

- **Dish Selection**: Customers can select multiple dishes from the menu, specifying the desired quantity for each dish.

- **Receipt Generation**: An itemized receipt is generated, displaying the selected dishes along with a grand total for verification.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Programming Language**: [Ruby].
- **Testing Framework**: [RSpec with JEST Testing].
- **Version Control**: Git was utilized to track changes and manage the project.

To explore this project and its functionality, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the provided test suite to ensure all features are working correctly.
4. Explore the source code to understand the implementation details.

## Reflection

During this project, I learned and applied various concepts, including test-driven development, object-oriented design, and debugging techniques. I focused on creating a food ordering system that meets the specified user stories and showcases my understanding of these principles.

I encountered challenges throughout the development process, which allowed me to strengthen my problem-solving skills and improve my proficiency in mock testing and integration tests

I hope this project demonstrates my growth and expertise in software engineering, and I look forward to further enhancing my skills in future projects.
